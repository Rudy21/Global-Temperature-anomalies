#🌍 Global Temperature Anomalies Dashboard | Tableau Project

📊 Project Title: Visualizing Climate Change Through Temperature Anomalies
🛠️ Tool Used: Tableau
📂 Dataset: Global Temperature Anomalies (possibly from NASA, NOAA, or similar sources)

🔍 Project Overview
In this Tableau project, I explored historical global temperature anomalies to visualize and analyze the impact of climate change over the decades.
This interactive dashboard offers clear, compelling visuals to communicate how Earth's average temperatures have shifted over time—and how different regions are being impacted disproportionately.

🧭 Key Features
📈 Time-series analysis of global temperature anomalies since pre-industrial times
🗺️ Geospatial heat maps to show regional trends and warming intensity
🧊 Focused insights on decade-wise warming trends, seasonal shifts, and year-over-year deviations
🎯 Clean and intuitive dashboard design with slicers for region, year, and temperature range

🌱 Why It Matters
This project reflects how data visualization can support sustainability and awareness initiatives. By turning raw climate data into clear narratives, we can support scientists, policymakers, and the public in understanding the urgency of climate action.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
Tableau dashboarding best practices
Data preparation and aggregation
Custom tooltips, filters, and interactive parameters
Analytical storytelling using time-series and geospatial data

🚀 What’s Next?
Add climate event overlays (El Niño, volcanic eruptions, etc.)
Incorporate CO₂ emission and sea-level rise datasets
Publish the dashboard on Tableau Public for broader accessibility
